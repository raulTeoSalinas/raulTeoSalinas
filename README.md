👋 Howdy there, fellow explorer of the digital realm! I'm Raul T. Salinas, a versatile full-stack developer on a perpetual quest to craft immersive web and mobile experiences. 🗡️ Armed with the symphony of TypeScript, the artistry of React, and the choreography of SQL – including PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, and even the enigmatic GraphQL – I orchestrate digital realms that resonate. The dance extends to PHP and Laravel, where I weave intricate back-end magic.

🎓 Currently, I'm just two semesters away from completing my bachelors degree at UNAM in IT, where I've been delving into the intricacies of algorithms and code architecture, uncovering my unwavering passion.

💼 As we speak, I'm weaving code spells at CIC-UNAM, where creativity and innovation converge to birth digital marvels. From ideation to deployment, I thrive on transforming visions into pixel-perfect reality.

🎶 Beyond the confines of code, you'll find me lost in the melodies of music production. I'm not only a creator of digital experiences but also a curator of EDM tracks. Tune in to my beats at https://open.spotify.com/artist/5HPUKzBYiCdbSNPqceY9lq?si=or6fcB7GSUGQFT0YS8xJaA.
