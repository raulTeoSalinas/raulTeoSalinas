👋 Howdy there, fellow explorer of the digital realm! I'm Raul T. Salinas, a versatile full-stack developer on a perpetual quest to craft immersive web and mobile experiences. 

🗡️ Armed with the symphony of TypeScript, the artistry of React, and the choreography of SQL – including PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, and even the enigmatic GraphQL – I orchestrate digital realms that resonate. But that's not all – I've also mastered the intricacies of backend development with Google Cloud, Cloud Run, Docker, Directus, Firebase, PHP, and Laravel, adding layers of complexity and power to my creations.
And when it comes to mobile app development, I'm equally adept. Whether it's the swift movements of Swift, the versatile capabilities of React Native, or the robustness of Kotlin, I can navigate the diverse landscapes of mobile development with finesse and precision.

🎓 Currently, I'm just ONE semester away from completing my bachelors degree at UNAM in IT, where I've been delving into the intricacies of algorithms and code architecture, uncovering my unwavering passion.

💼 As we speak, I'm weaving code spells at CIC-UNAM, where creativity and innovation converge to birth digital marvels. From ideation to deployment, I thrive on transforming visions into pixel-perfect reality.

🎶 Beyond the confines of code, you'll find me lost in the melodies of music production. I'm not only a creator of digital experiences but also a curator of EDM tracks. Tune in to my beats at https://open.spotify.com/artist/5HPUKzBYiCdbSNPqceY9lq?si=or6fcB7GSUGQFT0YS8xJaA.
